Thoughts on each problem

1: Palindromes
This was fairly straight forward.  Added the string library to simplify finding
the length of the string, but decided to do c-style character access in the loop
to keep comparison simple.

2: Data Structures
Decided to add another stack to the class to track the high value, slightly more
memory usage, but better access time and saves searching for current high value
when the stack is pushed or popped.

3: Game Logic
Several different approaches possible, Breadth First, or Dijkstra's algorithm
are the two most obvious for the solution.  As the graph was unweighted I
decided upon using a simple breadth first approach rather than a full
Dijkstra's implementation.  Built using recursion primarily to demonstrate
a breadth of knowledge, although the use of recursion did result in a bit of
awkward poorly scaling code to deal with previously visited nodes in the graph.
